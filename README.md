# Automata Theory - Application Tester

## About
Automata Theory - Application Tester (AT-AT) is a web-based, canvas-based software for testing application of automata theory content. Currently, the tool provides a means to test the user's ability of creating equivalent NFA/DFA for a given regular expression.

## How it works
Firstly, a user receives a randomly generated regular expression. Next, they draw an NFA/DFA to the canvas that accepts precisely the same language as the regex. Lastly, they check if what they've drawn does indeed accept the same language as the regex. The user can repeatedly generate new regular expressions to continue testing their ability.

## Running the program
No additional libraries are required to run the program. Simply open the HTML file in a browser to use the application, ensuring the CSS and JavaScript files are in the same directory as the HTML file.
